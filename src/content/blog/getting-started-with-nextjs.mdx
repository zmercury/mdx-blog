# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build fast, modern websites. In this guide, we'll explore how to get started with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Fast static pages
- **API Routes**: Backend functionality
- **File-based Routing**: Simple and intuitive routing
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Including CSS Modules and Sass

## Setting Up Your Project

To create a new Next.js project with TypeScript, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
```

This will create a new project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   └── layout.tsx
│   ├── components/
│   └── lib/
├── public/
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Creating Your First Page

In Next.js 13+, we use the App Router. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## TypeScript Integration

TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience. Here's an example of using TypeScript with Next.js:

```tsx
interface Post {
  title: string
  content: string
  date: string
}

export default function BlogPost({ post }: { post: Post }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
      <time>{post.date}</time>
    </article>
  )
}
```
